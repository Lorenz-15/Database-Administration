          Each weekend, at race venues the world over, there is one rider who
          gets hoisted upon the shoulders of the crowd and carried to the
          podium. Or at least leaves with a water bottle as their prize. And
          between each of those races, innumerable wannabes are putting in the
          hours on the rollers and in the gym all because they want to feel what
          it’s like to take the win. They know that to beat the pack every
          advantage needs to be acquired. That’s where the Blur fits in. We
          tapped into everything we’ve learned from years of making the highest
          quality carbon full-suspension bikes so that we could put as little
          (weight) as possible into the Blur frame. The trim frame and
          super-efficient Superlight™ suspension will be the key to translating
          your input into competition beating performances.
