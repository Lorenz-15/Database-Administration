        <div class="details">
            <p>The definition of “road cycling” now includes gravel and dirt as well as pavement. At the same time,
                bikes are evolving to meet the fit requirements of smaller riders. Meeting these two distinct needs was
                the driving force behind the Zipp 303 Firecrest 650b Tubeless Disc-brake wheelset. The smaller rim size
                provides room within frames and forks for larger tires, 28mm or wider, that deliver increased comfort,
                compliance, and cornering performance. With more tire between the rim and the ground, the overall wheel
                diameter including the tire is similar to a standard 700c wheel and road tire combination. Back on the
                pavement, the 650b is a better fitting wheel for smaller athletes riding compatible frames. For too
                long, many smaller cyclists have trained and raced on standard 700c wheels, losing out on the advantages
                of a proper fitting wheel such as improved handling and the elimination of front wheel-toe overlap. At
                the center of the 303 650b Firecrest Tubeless is a versatile and durable hubset, the German-engineered
                ZR1 DB.</p>
